# ReferenceStyleTemplateGenerator
Using ChatGPT to generate templates of reference style based on user-provided examples.

If a pre-made style file for the format you need isn't available, editing EndNote's output style to match a publication's guidelines can be tedious. However, we can use language processing models to create a template directly from the journal's formatted examples. This GPT is designed to create templates that integrate well with EndNote outputs, though minor modifications might be necessary.
